                <!-- <p>Dear Professor,</p> -->
                <p>

                    I am a student who wants to study Computer Science in King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi. When I was young, I really loved playing games, so I thought it would be great if I could make games myself. That’s why I started learning programming. From there, I began taking Web design classes. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At, first, it was really difficult for me, but later on, I started to understand more and more. In the course, my favorite part became solving errors. I even enjoyed helping my friends’ errors whenever they faced. I’ve also created personal projects, which I’ve shared on GitHub, and I plan to continue developing my skills. I want to become a game developer someday. However, I haven’t learned anything related to that yet. In the future, I plan to study game engines, 3D modeling, and artificial intelligence in games. I dream of working at a big company like Rockstar, Tencent and Moonton. I’ve been independently studying Computer Science concepts through online platforms like YouTube and freeCodeCamp. There is so much to say about why I like to study this subject, but it will make the statement very long. So, let’s get back to the reason why I’d like choose KMUTT University. First thing is I believe that KMUTT can provide helpful environment for their students, I heard that facilities and assistants are very efficient in KMUTT compared to other universities. Second is that KMUTT can also provide sustainable careers for its students and its high ranking is a thing to consider about applying for students who are interested in engineering majors. Another reason I chose university in Thailand is because it’s close to Myanmar and has a similar culture. </p>

                    As I am a kind of person who likes to learn modern technology, I once learned about hardware engineering, and got A+ certificate. I’ve got a little knowledge about wiring the electric parts and networking. I used to learn about programming: web-development and photoshop as well. While learning programming, we had to work as a group and I was responsible for a leader role, so I managed how to create a small group project and it went well. From my experience, working with the team is very proficient than working alone. I also enjoy playing sports and esports. To become very skillful in these fields, you need to be patient and consistent and having teamwork skill is essential. I’d also liked to apply for the scholarship program if I can. A scholarship would ease the financial burden on my family and it let me to focus on my study. The scholarship will help me to gain the long-term achievements. If there is a chance that I might lose financial supports from my family, granting scholarship can only help me to continue my educational life. Because economy of my country is getting horrible and terrifying things are happening, financial supports from my family are unpredictable. That’s why I consider the scholarship as an indeed need. Receiving financial supports from scholarship program could make a massive impact on my student life.</p>

<p>  In conclusion, my desire to study at KMUTT, and commitment to learning make me strong candidate for this admission. I am keen to devote to this field and take all advantages of the opportunities that KMUTT has to offer. I am determined to work hard, study and use my education to make a significant impact on my community. After graduating, I hope to use my skills to develop applications that can inspire and entertain others, especially in Thailand, where digital technology is growing. I want to become a software engineer or game developer who brings value to both the global and local communities. Thank you for considering and reading my application. I am eager to take this chance to have success in my life.

</p>

</p>
                <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,<br>Myat Thu</p>
